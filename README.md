- **QR Code Generation**: Automatically generate QR codes for each shortened URL.
- **Click Tracking**: Monitor how many times your shortened links have been clicked.
- **RESTful API**: Programmatically create and manage shortened URLs.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of shortened URLs.
- **Detailed Analytics**: View creation date and usage statistics for each URL.
- **Base62 Encoding**: Industry-standard URL shortening algorithm for optimal link length.


# üèóÔ∏è 12-Factor App Implementation

This application follows the [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys
   - Single repository with clear separation of code and configuration

2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
   - All dependencies are declared in `requirements.txt` with specific versions

3. **Config**: Store config in the environment
   - All configuration is stored in environment variables
   - Sample `.env.example` file provided for reference

4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
   - Database connection is configured via environment variables
   - Supports different database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
   - Docker build process separates these stages
   - Docker Compose for orchestration

6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
   - Application is stateless and can be scaled horizontally
   - All state is stored in the database

7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
   - Application binds to a port specified in environment variables
   - Easily configurable for different environments

8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
   - FastAPI's async support allows for concurrent request handling
   - Can be scaled horizontally with multiple instances

9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
   - Fast startup and shutdown hooks for clean resource management
   - Proper database connection handling

10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    - Same codebase and dependencies across environments
    - Environment-specific configuration via environment variables

11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
    - Structured logging with timestamps and log levels
    - Logs directed to stdout/stderr for collection by platform

12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
    - Admin endpoints for maintenance tasks
    - Can be triggered via API calls

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM
- **Databases**: Async database support
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for the web interface
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the application
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirajkark/URL_shorten.git
cd URL_shorten
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn jinja2 pydantic qrcode[pil]
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

- The web UI will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
- The API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## üöÄ Usage

### Web Interface
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
2. Enter a URL in the form to shorten it.
3. Optionally, specify a custom alias and an expiration date.
4. Submit the form to create a shortened URL.
5. View details of a shortened URL by clicking on its ID, including a QR code.
6. Delete URLs directly from the UI.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/url**: Create a shortened URL.
  - Example: `{"target_url": "https://example.com", "custom_alias": "myalias", "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59"}`
- **GET /api/url/{url_id}**: Get details of a shortened URL.
- **GET /api/urls**: List all shortened URLs.
- **DELETE /api/url/{url_id}**: Delete a shortened URL.
- **GET /health**: Check the API's health status.

### QR Code
- Access the QR code for a shortened URL at `/qr/{url_id}`.
- Displayed on the details page for each URL.

## üìñ Code Structure

- **main.py**: Core application logic, including FastAPI setup, routes, and URL shortening functionality.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for the web interface (e.g., `index.html`, `details.html`, `error.html`).
- **static/**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, and generated QR code images).

## üîß Extending the Project

### Custom Short URLs
- Users can specify a custom alias (3-15 alphanumeric characters) when creating a URL.
- Validation ensures the alias is unique.

### Expiration Dates
- URLs can have an optional expiration date.
- Expired URLs will not redirect and will display an error message.

### QR Code Generation
- QR codes are generated for each shortened URL using the `qrcode` library.
- Accessible via the `/qr/{url_id}` endpoint and displayed on the details page.

### Future Enhancements
- **Persistent Storage**: Replace the in-memory database with SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts for managing URLs.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Track IP addresses, user agents, and referral sources for clicks.
